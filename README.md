# Sample LaTeX Template

### Mostly uses the sample from AASTeX 6.1, but with a few improvements:

* Less stuff to delete
* Uses BibTeX
* Automatically links to ADS for the references
* Includes my script for syncing with my master Bib file
* Has `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` already started

One way to start a project is the following

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eas342/templateArticle.git

rm -R .git/
git init
```
