# To Do List for NIRCam Lab Paper

### Overall

 - Shrink down paper
 - Move fine details to appendix
 
### Known Detector Effects

- Improve fringing section - I think we can see this after removing FF
   * Fit a sin(x^2) or something?
   
- Put in Inter-Boresight motion effects for subpixel crosshatching

### Ground-Based Tests

- OTIS darks w/ Grism aperture
   - Make a tool to calculate impact of 1/f noise

- CV3 
   - Expand w/ previous results?
       Description of sub vs full frame
       Row-by-row subtraction
       Aperture size
       IPC & flat fielding had small impacts for these tests

- GL Dewar Tests
   - Remove results on older reductions/ earlier tests that don't add to discussion

- OTIS grism
   - Continue analysis of differential spectrum - need to model Temp variations?
   
   
- ASIC Dewar
   - Shorten RPI vs RPF
   - Remove subarray size test once it is sorted out
   - Shorten Multi-aperture test
   - Co-adding - move to appendix
   - Delete tests before we had good Box Temperatures (move to supplement writeup)
   - Delete NFF tests (move to supplement writeup)
   - Delete IDle vs exposing (move to supplement writeup)
   - Delete Illumination pattern changes? (move to supplement writeup)

- Noise floor
   - Re-write after knowledge gained
